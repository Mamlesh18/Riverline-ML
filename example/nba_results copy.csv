To help resolve this quickly, could you DM me details about the specific issues you're experiencing? I'm ready to assist you now. *JonPorter","The customer has expressed negative sentiment and a medium level of urgency. They have previously used Twitter for communication. Given the 'follow_up' conversation type and the customer's direct complaint about customer service, a quick response via Twitter DM is appropriate to acknowledge their frustration and offer immediate assistance. The message directly addresses the customer's complaint about the past 3 years and prompts them to provide specific details via DM, allowing for a more private and detailed discussion. The timing is within the 4-8 hour window for medium urgency, taking into account the last interaction time. The polite customer behavior suggests they are open to a resolution if addressed promptly and empathetically.","pending_customer_reply","2017-09-26 21:39:47 | 117150: Worse experience @USER 0 customer service. 3 years of this? | 2017-09-26 21:43:31 | TMobileHelp: @USER Hey, Abdul!

"116859","1000","twitter_dm_reply","2017-11-01T09:00:00Z","Hi 116859, @USER We understand your frustration with the iOS update. Since it started immediately after the update, let's try a quick fix. Please try a force restart: quickly press and release the volume up button, quickly press and release the volume down button, then press and hold the side button. Let us know if that helps!","The customer is clearly impatient and frustrated ('please make this stop!!!'). The issue started immediately after the iOS update, suggesting a software glitch. Given the medium urgency and the customer's impatience, a quick response via Twitter DM is optimal. A force restart is a common troubleshooting step for iOS issues and can often resolve immediate problems. The message acknowledges the customer's frustration, provides a clear, actionable step, and sets the expectation that it's a potential 'quick fix'. The timing is immediate, as the customer is actively engaged and impatient. We are choosing Twitter DM because of the customer's impatience and the need for a quick response. The suggested solution is a simple troubleshooting step that can be easily communicated via Twitter.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:08:51 | 116859: @USER please make this stop!!! | 2017-10-31 23:08:51 | 116859: @USER please make this stop!!! | 2017-10-31 23:22:28 | AppleSupport: @USER Let‚Äôs work together on this behavior.

"116987","1001","twitter_dm_reply","2017-11-01T09:00:14Z","Hi 116987, @USER We're so glad you enjoyed the Centurion Lounge in PHL! Is there anything we can help you with regarding lounge access or other product info?","The customer expressed positive sentiment and mentioned a specific product (Centurion Lounge) and location (PHL) on Twitter. While the nature of the request is 'product_info' and the customer is 'confused', the initial message is positive and seems more like a general comment than a specific request. Replying on Twitter is appropriate given the original interaction occurred there and the urgency is medium. The message acknowledges their positive feedback and proactively offers assistance, which aligns with the 'positive_feedback', 'airport_lounge', 'customer_satisfaction', 'brand_mention', and 'social_media_engagement' tags. A direct question is posed to clarify if they need assistance, making it a quick and efficient way to address their potential confusion.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:09:14 | 116987: I don't need a lot to be happy - a @USER and @USER Centurion lounge in the same airport pretty much does it.

"116863","1002","twitter_dm_reply","2017-11-01T18:00:00Z","Hi 116863, @USER Thanks for the update! Since you've installed 4.1, let's see if that resolves the battery drain. If you're still experiencing issues in the next 24 hours, please DM us again, and we'll explore other options. We appreciate your patience!","The customer is clearly frustrated and impatient, as evidenced by their initial message and the 'Impatient Customers' cohort. They've also just installed the 4.1 update, which they hope will fix the issue. Given their impatience and the fact that they've taken action (installing the update), a quick Twitter reply acknowledging their update and setting a clear expectation for follow-up is the best approach. This provides immediate acknowledgment and avoids overwhelming them with detailed troubleshooting steps before seeing if the update resolves the problem. The medium urgency and frustration level suggest a faster response than email, and the issue isn't complex enough to warrant a phone call at this stage. The timing is within business hours and allows the customer time to test the update.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:09:18 | 116863: Series1 would consistently get 18 hrs + per charge prior to last update.

I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. To get this resolved quickly, could you please DM me your account number and address so I can investigate both issues immediately? -STS","The customer is clearly frustrated and impatient, as evidenced by their language and the tags associated with their account. They have both a cable and internet issue, escalating the urgency. While a phone call might be ideal for complex issues, the customer's impatience suggests a quicker response via Twitter DM is more appropriate initially. This allows for immediate acknowledgment and a request for information to start troubleshooting. The message acknowledges their frustration and provides a clear next step. The timing is within the 4-8 hour window for medium urgency, but closer to the immediate end due to the customer's impatience. We are requesting information, so the issue status will be pending customer reply.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:09:28 | 117298: You know what the best part about being a @USER customer is?
