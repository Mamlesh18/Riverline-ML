"117150","10","twitter_dm_reply","2017-11-07T09:00:00Z","Hi 117150, @USER Abdul, we're so sorry to hear you've had a frustrating experience. We see you've been a customer for 3 years and we value your business. We'd like to look into this right away. Could you please DM us some details about the issue you're experiencing? *JonPorter","The customer has expressed negative sentiment and tagged the company in a public tweet, indicating a desire for a quick resolution and public acknowledgment. The urgency is medium. While a phone call might be suitable for a frustrated customer, the existing chat history shows that the customer has already been directed to DM for assistance. Responding via Twitter DM acknowledges their public complaint and continues the existing conversation thread. The message acknowledges their frustration, references their tenure as a customer (3 years), and prompts them to provide details in a DM, which is consistent with the previous interaction. The timing is within 4-8 hours of their last message, aligning with the medium urgency level. This approach is optimal because it addresses the customer's public complaint quickly and efficiently, while also directing them to a private channel for detailed assistance.","pending_customer_reply","2017-09-26 21:39:47 | 117150: Worse experience @USER 0 customer service. 3 years of this? | 2017-09-26 21:43:31 | TMobileHelp: @USER Hey, Abdul!

"116859","1000","twitter_dm_reply","2017-11-01T09:00:00Z","Hi 116859, @USER We understand your frustration with the iOS update. Since it started immediately after the update, let's try a quick fix. Please try a force restart: quickly press and release the volume up button, quickly press and release the volume down button, then press and hold the side button. Let us know if that helps!","The customer is clearly impatient and frustrated ('please make this stop!!!'). The issue seems to be directly related to the iOS update on their iPhone 7. While the urgency is medium, their impatience suggests a quicker response is better. A Twitter DM allows for a fast response and a simple troubleshooting step (force restart) can be easily communicated. The message acknowledges their frustration and provides a clear, actionable step. Since the issue is potentially a software glitch related to the update, a simple restart might resolve it quickly. Given the customer's impatience, a faster channel like Twitter is preferred over email or scheduling a call at this stage. The send time is set to immediately after analysis to address the customer's impatience.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:08:51 | 116859: @USER please make this stop!!! | 2017-10-31 23:08:51 | 116859: @USER please make this stop!!! | 2017-10-31 23:22:28 | AppleSupport: @USER Let‚Äôs work together on this behavior.

"116987","1001","twitter_dm_reply","2017-11-01T09:00:00Z","Hi 116987, Hey @USER! Glad you're enjoying the Centurion Lounge at PHL. To clarify, are you looking for info on lounge access or something else? Let me know!","The customer's initial tweet expresses positive sentiment about the Centurion Lounge at PHL. However, the 'product_info' tag and 'confused' customer behavior suggest they might have a question or need clarification. Since the urgency is medium and the conversation type is a simple inquiry, a quick Twitter DM reply is appropriate. This allows for a fast follow-up and avoids overwhelming the customer with a detailed email or phone call. The message acknowledges their positive sentiment and directly asks for clarification, addressing the potential confusion. Sending the message within 6 hours (5:00 AM UTC) aligns with the medium urgency and considers a reasonable response time after the initial tweet.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:09:14 | 116987: I don't need a lot to be happy - a @USER and @USER Centurion lounge in the same airport pretty much does it.

"117298","1003","twitter_dm_reply","2017-11-02T12:00:00Z","Hi 117298, @USER I understand your frustration with the cable sound and internet outage. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. To help immediately, could you DM me your account number and address so I can check the service status in your area and troubleshoot the equipment? We'll get this fixed ASAP.","Given the customer's impatient behavior, medium urgency, and frustration expressed on Twitter, a quick response on the same platform is optimal. The customer has already expressed their frustration publicly, so addressing it publicly (but moving to DM for privacy) acknowledges their feelings and demonstrates responsiveness. The message acknowledges their specific issues (cable sound and internet outage), expresses empathy, and provides a clear next step (DMing account information for troubleshooting). This approach aims to quickly address the immediate problem and prevent further escalation. The timing is within business hours and shortly after the last interaction, showing attentiveness.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:09:28 | 117298: You know what the best part about being a @USER customer is?
