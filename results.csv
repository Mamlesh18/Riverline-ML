We're ready to assist you there. *JonPorter","The customer has expressed negative sentiment and medium urgency. The customer has already been directed to DM, and has sent one. Responding in the same channel (Twitter DM) is the most efficient way to continue the conversation. The message acknowledges the customer's frustration and references the '3 years' comment to show understanding. It also prompts the customer to provide more details, which is necessary to resolve the issue. The timing is within 4-8 hours of the last message, aligning with the medium urgency level. Using the same agent's name (*JonPorter) provides continuity.","pending_customer_reply","2017-09-26 21:39:47 | 117150: Worse experience @USER 0 customer service. 3 years of this? | 2017-09-26 21:39:47 | 117150: Worse experience @USER 0 customer service. 3 years of this? | 2017-09-26 21:43:31 | TMobileHelp: @USER Hey, Abdul!

The team is working to get all devices updated. In the meantime, could you tell us which phone you're using so we can check compatibility?","The customer is frustrated and confused about app inconsistency, as indicated by their message 'I can't even find it on my phone wtf @USER why don't your apps work the same.' The urgency is medium. Given the customer's impatience (using 'wtf') and the simple inquiry nature, a quick response via Twitter DM is appropriate. Acknowledging their frustration and asking for the phone model allows us to provide a more tailored response and potentially resolve the issue quickly. The time is set to 6 AM UTC, which is 1 AM EST, assuming the customer is in the Eastern Time Zone. This is outside of business hours, but responding quickly on Twitter is important to address the customer's impatience. The previous response from Hulu support was not helpful in resolving the issue, so a more direct and personalized approach is needed.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-30 00:19:32 | 116440: I can't even find it on my phone wtf @USER why don't your apps work the same. | 2017-10-31 22:56:31 | hulu_support: @USER We haven't updated all devices to the new experience, so there are differences.

Since your account may be compromised, we need to act quickly. We'll DM you a secure link to verify your identity and regain access to your account. Please check your DMs shortly.","Given Melanie's negative sentiment ('hacked'), medium urgency, and impatient behavior (multiple reset requests, 'What can I do?'), a quick response is crucial. The tags 'account_security', 'password_reset', 'email_issue', and 'potential_account_compromise' indicate a security concern that needs immediate attention. While phone support is often preferred for compromised accounts, the previous attempt to direct her to a phone call was unsuccessful and resulted in no further interaction. Therefore, a direct, actionable step via Twitter DM is the best approach to re-engage her and address the immediate need for account access. Providing a secure link directly addresses her request and demonstrates immediate action, which is vital for an impatient customer with a potential security breach. The timing is immediate to address the urgency.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-30 00:59:06 | 115941: @USER Hi! Someone changed my password (hacked).

Since it's been happening for two weeks, let's try a few quick troubleshooting steps. Could you please confirm the device you're using? In the meantime, try clearing the app cache and restarting your device. Let us know if that helps!","The customer is clearly frustrated and impatient, as indicated by their message and customer cohorts. The urgency is medium. Given the customer's impatience and the simple nature of the initial troubleshooting steps, a quick response via Twitter DM is the best approach. The message acknowledges their frustration, offers a simple solution (clearing cache and restarting), and requests specific information (device type) to further diagnose the issue. This allows for a fast initial response and keeps the conversation moving. Email would be too slow, and a phone call is not yet necessary for this initial troubleshooting.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-30 01:07:48 | 116165: Hey @USER your app has had a “loading error” for the two weeks, thought I’d let you know I’ve been paying for aggravation rather than tv | 2017-10-30 01:07:48 | 116165: Hey @USER your app has had a “loading error” for the two weeks, thought I’d let you know I’ve been paying for aggravation rather than tv | 2017-10-30 01:07:48 | 116165: Hey @USER your app has had a “loading error” for the two weeks, thought I’d let you know I’ve been paying for aggravation rather than tv | 2017-10-30 01:07:48 | 116165: Hey @USER your app has had a “loading error” for the two weeks, thought I’d let you know I’ve been paying for aggravation rather than tv | 2017-10-31 22:41:30 | hulu_support: @USER Oh no!

To quickly resolve this, could you DM us your email address associated with your Hulu account so we can investigate? We'll get this sorted out ASAP.","Given the customer's negative sentiment, medium urgency, simple inquiry, and impatient behavior, a quick response via Twitter DM is optimal. The customer's initial message clearly states the problem (unauthorized charge). The previous response directed the customer to call, which is not ideal for an impatient customer with a simple inquiry. Acknowledging their frustration and requesting the email address allows for a targeted investigation and a faster resolution than scheduling a phone call or sending a detailed email. The timing is within the 4-8 hour window for medium urgency and addresses the issue promptly. By requesting the email via DM, we are also protecting the customer's privacy.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-30 01:09:31 | 116444: @USER Hi i was charged for a subscription and didn't sign up for it | 2017-10-30 01:09:31 | 116444: @USER Hi i was charged for a subscription and didn't sign up for it | 2017-10-31 22:46:26 | hulu_support: @USER Uh oh!

We also have season 1 dubbed. Could you please tell us what device you're using to watch Hulu? This will help us troubleshoot.","The customer is asking about the availability of 'My Hero Academia' episodes. While Hulu Support already responded with the available episodes, the customer is still likely experiencing an issue finding them. Given the 'quick_resolution' tag and the customer's technical behavior (likely indicating they've already tried basic troubleshooting), a quick follow-up on Twitter DM is appropriate. Asking about the device they are using will help narrow down the issue and provide more targeted assistance. The urgency is medium, so responding within 4-8 hours is acceptable, but since the previous response was recent, a faster reply is better. The customer sentiment is positive, so a friendly and helpful tone is suitable.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-30 01:22:08 | 116443: @USER where r the rest of my hero academia ? | 2017-10-30 01:22:08 | 116443: @USER where r the rest of my hero academia ? | 2017-10-31 22:49:08 | hulu_support: @USER Hey there!

While we don't have a confirmed date yet, we'll be sure to announce it on our social channels as soon as we do. In the meantime, you can check out other awesome shows like [Suggest a similar show available on Hulu]. Thanks for your patience!","Given the customer's impatient behavior and the simple inquiry about content availability, a quick response via Twitter DM is optimal. The customer has already used Twitter to inquire, indicating a preference for this channel. The urgency is medium, so a response within 4-8 hours is appropriate. The message acknowledges their eagerness, provides a reason for the lack of a specific date (no ETA), and offers an alternative suggestion to mitigate frustration. Providing a similar show to watch helps to retain the customer and shows that we are listening to their needs. The time is set to 6:00 AM UTC, which is 1:00 AM EST, which is outside of business hours. This is because the last interaction was late at night, and responding quickly, even if outside business hours, aligns with the customer's impatient behavior. Acknowledging the lack of a confirmed date sets realistic expectations.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-30 01:32:41 | 116436: When’s season 3 of Rick and Morty going to be on @USER? | 2017-10-30 01:32:41 | 116436: When’s season 3 of Rick and Morty going to be on @USER? | 2017-10-31 22:59:20 | hulu_support: @USER We don't have an ETA on those episodes just yet.

Would you be open to a quick DM to explore some workarounds for profile management on your Smart TV?","The customer is impatient and has expressed their frustration publicly on Twitter. While their sentiment is positive, their impatience and medium urgency level suggest a quick response is needed. The issue is a feature request, which is relatively simple. Given the customer's impatience, a Twitter DM reply is the best channel for a fast response. The message acknowledges their frustration, assures them their feedback is being considered, and offers a potential workaround, showing we're actively trying to help. Offering a DM allows for a more private conversation to explore workarounds without publicly committing to a timeline for the feature request. The send time is within business hours and shortly after the previous interaction, addressing the customer's impatience.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-30 01:33:46 | 116442: Hey @USER, get your act together and put the select profile option on smart TVs already.

Given the customer's impatience and the relatively simple troubleshooting step (force restart), a quick response via Twitter DM is the best approach. The message acknowledges their frustration, provides a clear and actionable step, and sets the expectation that it's a potential quick fix. We are suggesting a force restart because it is a common solution for issues that arise immediately after an update.

Let us know!","The customer's initial message expresses positive sentiment and mentions a brand mention (@USER). The nature of the request is 'product_info' and the customer is 'confused'. Given the positive sentiment, medium urgency, and the fact that the initial interaction occurred on Twitter, a Twitter DM reply is the most appropriate channel. This allows for a quick and informal response. The message acknowledges their positive feedback, attempts to clarify their request, and encourages further interaction. The timing is immediate, as it's within the same timeframe as the original tweet and falls within the acceptable response window for medium urgency.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:09:14 | 116987: I don't need a lot to be happy - a @USER and @USER Centurion lounge in the same airport pretty much does it.

We appreciate your patience!","The customer is frustrated and impatient, indicated by their initial message ('Wtf @USER ?') and the 'Impatient Customers' cohort. They've also just updated to watchOS 4.1, which they hope will fix the issue. A quick Twitter DM reply acknowledges their update and sets a clear expectation (24-hour monitoring period). This addresses their impatience by providing an immediate response and a defined timeframe for resolution. Since the customer is already trying a potential solution (the update), a phone call is premature. Email would be too slow for this impatient customer.

The send time is set for 9 AM local time the next day, assuming the customer is in a US time zone, to ensure it's within business hours.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:13:13 | 116856: @USER tell me why I️’I’ve updated my phone twice and I️ can’t type letter I️ without getting a letter A and a question mark | 2017-10-31 23:13:13 | 116856: @USER tell me why I️’I’ve updated my phone twice and I️ can’t type letter I️ without getting a letter A and a question mark | 2017-10-31 23:24:52 | AppleSupport: @USER We're here for you.

In the meantime, could you please confirm the order number so we can track it more efficiently? - Ceri","Given the customer's frustration, impatience, and the fact that they are now at work, a quick response via Twitter DM is the best approach. The customer has already expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of phone support. The message acknowledges their frustration, shows empathy, and sets a clear expectation of a 2-hour follow-up. Requesting the order number allows for immediate action and demonstrates a commitment to resolving the issue quickly. The use of Ceri's name adds a personal touch. The urgency level is medium, but the customer's impatience and the previous customer service failure warrant a faster response than email would provide.

The previous suggestion to update to iOS 11.1 failed to resolve the problem, indicating a need for more specific troubleshooting. Given the customer's impatience and the need for a relatively quick response, Twitter DM is the optimal channel. The message acknowledges their frustration, shows empathy, and provides a clear next step (providing device information). Requesting the device model and iOS version allows for tailored advice, increasing the likelihood of resolution.

The issue is likely complex and requires a personal touch to rebuild trust and provide immediate guidance. The customer has explicitly stated their dissatisfaction with previous interactions, so continuing via Twitter DM is unlikely to be effective.

The customer's sentiment is positive, but their behavior is impatient, as indicated by their cohort and the initial message. A quick Twitter DM reply is the best way to acknowledge their feedback and close the loop efficiently. Since the issue is a suggestion and not a problem requiring immediate action, a Twitter DM is sufficient.

The customer's last message indicated understanding ('Oohhh...ok'). Given the 'follow_up' conversation type, 'neutral' sentiment, and the 'quick_resolution' tag, a quick confirmation via Twitter that online ordering is back online is the most efficient way to resolve the issue. The customer is also marked as 'impatient', making Twitter the preferred channel for a fast response.

The customer is tagged as 'impatient' and the urgency is 'medium'. A quick Twitter DM reply is best to acknowledge their frustration and address the immediate concern (late delivery) while also prompting them to check the order's contents. This allows for a fast resolution if the order is complete and correct, or allows us to quickly address any further issues with the contents. Email would be too slow for an impatient customer, and a phone call is unnecessary at this stage as the issue might be resolved with a simple confirmation.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:14:22 | 117208: @USER just for completeness ordered arrived just now... over an hour late | 2017-10-31 23:14:22 | 117208: @USER just for completeness ordered arrived just now... over an hour late | 2017-10-31 23:14:22 | 117208: @USER just for completeness ordered arrived just now... over an hour late | 2017-10-31 23:37:01 | Tesco: @USER I require your full name, address and email.

However, the system malfunctioned and posted the same question and answer multiple times, likely causing confusion. The customer is tagged as 'impatient' and has a 'medium' urgency level. Given the 'simple_inquiry' conversation type, the 'social_media_interaction' tag, and the customer's impatience, a quick response via Twitter DM is optimal. The message acknowledges the confusion, apologizes for the system error, confirms the availability of queso, and offers further assistance. This addresses the immediate issue and provides an opportunity to resolve any other potential concerns quickly, aligning with the 'quick_resolution' tag. Sending the message at 7:14:24 UTC (2:14 AM EST) is not ideal, but since the last interaction was late at night, responding as soon as possible after the system error is better than waiting until business hours.

We see you were on the phone with our team and they processed the refund. Could you please confirm if everything was resolved to your satisfaction? We want to ensure you're taken care of. ^HC","The customer is clearly impatient and was angry about a delayed delivery and refund, as evidenced by their initial messages and tags like 'angry_customer' and 'prime_dissatisfaction'. They stated they were on the phone with customer service and were told the refund was being processed. While the tag 'resolved_by_phone' exists, it's important to confirm with the customer directly that the issue is indeed resolved. Given their impatience and the nature of the platform they're using (Twitter), a quick Twitter DM reply is the best approach. The message acknowledges their frustration, references the phone call, and asks for confirmation of resolution. This allows for a fast response and shows we are attentive to their needs. Sending it immediately after the last interaction (within 30 minutes) is crucial to address their impatience. If they confirm resolution, the issue can be closed. If not, further action can be taken based on their response.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:15:37 | 117084: @USER estais de coña no?el reembolso lo quiero ya, era para un regalo para hoy y tenia que llegar ayer. | 2017-10-31 23:15:37 | 117084: @USER estais de coña no?el reembolso lo quiero ya, era para un regalo para hoy y tenia que llegar ayer. | 2017-10-31 23:17:28 | 117084: @USER Pago para tener el Prime con vosotros para que me tarden en llegar 10 dias?

The customer's message explicitly mentions the World Series, indicating a time-sensitive concern. Acknowledging their frustration and offering a direct path to resolution (DM for account details) addresses their immediate need for information and demonstrates responsiveness. The 'ASAP' promise sets a realistic expectation while conveying urgency.

We're here to help!","Given the customer's use of Twitter to mention Chipotle, their 'social_media_engagement' tag, and the 'positive_interaction' tag associated with their previous interaction, replying via Twitter DM is the most appropriate channel. The customer's 'impatient' behavior suggests a quick response is needed. While the nature of the request is 'account', the lack of specific details makes it a simple inquiry at this stage. The urgency is medium, so responding within 4-8 hours is acceptable. Sending the message at 7:00 AM UTC (which would be within business hours in many US time zones) ensures a timely response. The message acknowledges their social media post, expresses willingness to help, and requests further information via DM, keeping the interaction within the Twitter platform. This approach leverages their preferred channel and addresses their impatience by providing a prompt response.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:15:56 | 116974: Got dinner at @USER with @USER | 2017-10-31 23:15:56 | 116974: Got dinner at @USER with @USER | 2017-10-31 23:15:56 | 116974: Got dinner at @USER with @USER | 2017-10-31 23:15:56 | 116974: Got dinner at @USER with @USER | 2017-10-31 23:15:56 | 116974: Got dinner at @USER with @USER | 2017-10-31 23:28:55 | ChipotleTweets: @USER Lookin' good! -Becky | 2017-10-31 23:28:55 | ChipotleTweets: @USER Lookin' good! -Becky | 2017-10-31 23:28:55 | ChipotleTweets: @USER Lookin' good! -Becky | 2017-10-31 23:28:55 | ChipotleTweets: @USER Lookin' good! -Becky | 2017-10-31 23:28:55 | ChipotleTweets: @USER Lookin' good! -Becky"

The customer has already followed the account as requested. The message acknowledges their issue, expresses understanding, and requests specific information (payment confirmation and PSN ID) to resolve the account block. Requesting a screenshot of the payment confirmation directly addresses the core issue of the account being blocked despite payment.

This approach balances speed and security, addressing the customer's impatience while protecting their account information. The time is set to 9 AM local time (UTC-8) to align with business hours.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:20:43 | 117279: $3 burritos at @USER everyone 🍁🎃🍺👻 | 2017-10-31 23:20:43 | 117279: $3 burritos at @USER everyone 🍁🎃🍺👻 | 2017-10-31 23:20:43 | 117279: $3 burritos at @USER everyone 🍁🎃🍺👻 | 2017-10-31 23:20:43 | 117279: $3 burritos at @USER everyone 🍁🎃🍺👻 | 2017-10-31 23:34:39 | ChipotleTweets: @USER Heck yeah!

Since we already asked for your email via DM and haven't received it yet, could you please provide it so we can investigate this billing issue right away? We want to get this resolved for you quickly.","The customer is exhibiting impatient behavior ('uhhh') and has a negative sentiment. The urgency is medium. Given the customer's impatience and the need for a quick resolution, a Twitter DM reply is the best channel. The message acknowledges their frustration and reiterates the need for their email address to investigate the 'multiple_charges' issue, referencing the previous attempt to gather this information. The timing is set to the earliest possible within business hours (9 AM local time, which translates to 7 AM UTC, assuming a UTC+2 timezone for the business). This addresses the customer's impatience and aims for a swift resolution. We are prompting them to respond to the previous request instead of escalating to a phone call immediately, as the issue might be resolvable with a simple account lookup.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:21:21 | 117213: @USER y'all charged my account 8 times ..... uhhh | 2017-10-31 23:21:21 | 117213: @USER y'all charged my account 8 times ..... uhhh | 2017-10-31 23:30:59 | SpotifyCares: @USER Hey there!

I've flagged your account for immediate attention. Can you DM your account number so I can personally ensure the tech arrives as scheduled today and that you receive a credit for the inconvenience? ^PS","Given the customer's 'frustrated' sentiment, 'medium' urgency, and 'impatient' behavior, a quick response is crucial. The customer has already contacted customer service multiple times ('Called CS 4 x's') and was told a tech would come but didn't. They are also reliant on the internet for work ('Work depends on internet'). Replying via Twitter DM allows for immediate acknowledgment and a public commitment to resolving the issue. Offering to personally ensure the tech arrives and providing a credit addresses the customer's frustration and demonstrates empathy. Requesting the account number allows for immediate action. The timing is set for 9 AM to align with the start of business hours and the scheduled tech appointment.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:21:27 | 117300: @USER Cable &amp; internet out all day.Called CS 4 x's.No didn't come today as told.Frustrated AF. | 2017-10-31 23:21:27 | 117300: @USER Cable &amp; internet out all day.Called CS 4 x's.No didn't come today as told.Frustrated AF. | 2017-10-31 23:21:27 | 117300: @USER Cable &amp; internet out all day.Called CS 4 x's.No didn't come today as told.Frustrated AF. | 2017-10-31 23:33:53 | Ask_Spectrum: @USER Sorry our tech never came.

That's definitely not the experience we want you to have. I'm sending you a DM now to gather some account details and investigate this immediately. Please check your DMs. *MikeVance","The customer is experiencing a critical issue (potential privacy violation/security breach) and is highly urgent and upset. They are using Twitter, indicating a preference for quick communication. While a phone call might be ideal for this level of urgency, the immediate need to gather information and start the investigation warrants a DM response first. Responding via DM allows for a quick acknowledgment and initiation of the investigation process, while also providing a private channel to discuss sensitive account information. The message acknowledges their frustration, assures them of immediate action, and clearly states the next step (checking DMs). The timing is immediate to address the critical urgency. The previous response also used DM, so continuing on that channel is appropriate.","pending_customer_reply","2017-10-31 23:21:29 | 116940: @USER You guys just gave my phone number away after I called in a put on a security alert.
